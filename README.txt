Current draft tools for downloading, monitoring and viewing POCP outage data

In development. 

pocp.py contains the original (ad-hoc) python script used to download and stash POCP data.
This is currently in the process of being updated and "classified" in the pocp_tester.ipynb notebook file.  

The POCP has recently been made public and these tools may also work on the public site - not tested.
